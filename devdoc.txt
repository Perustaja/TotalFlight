## Entities
Entities follow DDD loosely. Where aggregates are appropriate, the root controls all updating of
its children. Aggregates will be kept small and not strictly break encapsulation via "...Child" methods.

### Aircraft Aggregate
Aircraft should be created with the same constructor, using nullable data passed in as JSON. Nullable 
data will be checked so the AircraftOptions must change the front-end form dynamically, sending
data that should be null with values or vice versa will result in an error. Navigational properties
are accessible but protected.

## Exceptions
Entity exceptions should not be encountered normally. These should only be thrown if someone modifies
a front-end form maliciously or a development error is created on the front-end.
